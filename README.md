About
=====
An xkcd Geeklet that displays the last comic, with title and alt text on your desk.

Installation
------------
Move `xkcd` to `/usr/local/bin` or edit `xkcd_shell.glet` accordingly.
Better if you place it in the PATH.

Usage
-----
Just add the geeklets to GeekTools, and run the python script in the shell. It'll download the new image and the description and information to /tmp/ and force GeekTools to reload via AppleScript.
